# BrainFuck part 3 - Write a BF interpreter in BF

The goal of this tutorial is to write our own BF interpreter... in BF

The different steps will be

* read instructions from input
* fetch instructions
* switch case on instruction codes
* implement memory moves < and >
* implement memory oeprations , . + and -
* implement loops
* have a working interpreter
* improve drastically the code

Have fun !
